🚗 "Road Accidents Analysis" – A Tableau Data Visualization Project 📊

🔍 Objective:
Delving into road accident data to pinpoint key factors influencing accidents and offering actionable insights to boost road safety.

🛠 Steps Taken:
✅ Gathered and scrubbed road accident data.
✅ Leveraged Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for enhanced visualization.
✅ Explored accident patterns based on location, weather conditions, road surfaces, and vehicle categories.
✅ Identified high-risk zones and peak accident timings.

📈 Key Insights:
📌 Adverse weather conditions (rain, fog) significantly spike accident occurrences.
📌 Intersections and highways emerge as accident hotspots.
📌 Speeding and distracted driving are prominent contributors to accidents.

💡 Recommendations:
✔️ Implement stricter speed limits in high-risk areas.
✔️ Improve road infrastructure & lighting in accident-prone spots.
✔️ Conduct awareness campaigns on safe driving practices & mobile phone usage.
✔️ Optimize traffic signals to reduce congestion-related accidents.
